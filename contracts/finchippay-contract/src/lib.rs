//! # FinchippayContract — Soroban Smart Contract
//!
//! A production-grade Soroban contract for the Finchippay-Solution platform on
//! the Stellar network. Provides:
//!
//! - **Tips**: one-shot token transfers recorded on-chain with aggregate stats.
//! - **Receipts**: immutable payment-receipt metadata minted by a payer.
//! - **Escrow**: time-locked token custody with claim / cancel flows.
//! - **Streaming Payments**: continuous per-ledger token streams that
//!   recipients can drain at any time; payers can top-up or close early.
//! - **Multi-Sig Payments**: N-of-M threshold approvals before a payment
//!   executes, fully on-chain with no trusted third-party.
//! - **Batch Sends**: fan-out a single token transfer to many recipients in
//!   one transaction, minimising fee overhead.
//!
//! ## Security model
//! - Every mutating entry-point calls `require_auth()` on the authorising
//!   party before touching any state.
//! - All arithmetic uses `checked_add` / `checked_sub` / `checked_mul` with
//!   explicit panics so overflows are never silently truncated.
//! - Storage TTLs are extended on every read and write to prevent ledger
//!   expiry from corrupting live streams or pending multi-sig proposals. Newly
//!   created entries start at the `MIN_TTL_LEDGERS` floor, later touches lift
//!   any entry that has decayed past `MIN_TTL_THRESHOLD`, and `bump_all_ttls`
//!   lets an admin sweep cold entries that nobody reads. `get_min_ttl` reports
//!   the lowest lifetime the contract can still prove, for off-chain alerting.
//! - **Emergency pause**: admin can freeze all value-transferring operations
//!   (circuit breaker pattern) to contain potential exploits.
//! - **Upgradability**: admin can point the contract at a new WASM hash to
//!   deploy security patches without migrating state.
//! - **Bounded inputs**: escrow release ledgers, stream deposits, and
//!   multi-sig amounts are capped to prevent griefing and permanent lock-up.
